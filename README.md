3- Boolean Type: bool:
Boolean values represent truth values. Python has two boolean values: True and False.

4- Sequence Types: list, tuple, range

Python has three sequence types:

list: Ordered and changeable collection of items. Lists are defined by square brackets ([]).
tuple: Ordered and unchangeable collection of items. Tuples are defined by parentheses (()).
range: A sequence of numbers. Ranges are defined by the range() function.
Mutable vs. Immutable
Mutable: Objects whose value can be changed after creation (e.g., lists).
Immutable: Objects whose value cannot be changed after creation (e.g., tuples, ranges and strings).
5- Mapping Type: dict
6- Set Types: set

Sets are unordered collections of unique items. Sets are defined by curly brackets ({}).
7- None Type: None
The None type represents the absence of a value. It is used to define a null value or no value at all.

A None value does not represent False or 0. It is a unique data type with only one value: None.
